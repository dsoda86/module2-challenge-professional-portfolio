# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio used advanced CSS skills to style customized web application. It includes sections about me, work down, and a contact me area. The works section includes completed
projects and some to come in the future. I learned a lot through trial and error with flexbox and still have much to learn as I did not complete the assignment up to standards. 
I started with one idea of trying to use a grid from the game that was linked after the flexbox one but decided to just use flexboxes after that failed. I should have started from 
scratch instead of transitioning the original model. This led to a confusing, cumbersome and incomplete project.
